# MineSweeper

This is a Javascript version for computers of the classic mine sweeper game with design similar to what could be seen in the earlier windows versions.

A simple rule based AI has been implemented and the ambition is to include more advanced rule based algorithms in the future as well as
testing out some reinforcement learning on this problem.
